# SQLite Client for Browser Apps

> A wrapper library around WASM builds of SQLite and SQLCipher that is compatible with the [sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/) API.

The goal here is to provide a nicer way of working with SQLite WASM that is compatible with other node libraries like [sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite), which although it is intended for Node.js, is a nice API that should hopefully work in the browser as well with this library through its [custom driver functionality](https://github.com/kriasoft/node-sqlite#with-a-custom-driver).
